This could include potential data related to employees or other parties where data protection and privacy are paramount considerations. With this in mind, one regulation that comes to mind as highly relevant for your project is:\n\n**The NIS Directive (NIS 2), specifically its updated version NIS 2/2016.** This directive outlines the requirements for critical aspects of the internal networks and information systems of member states, including those handling electronic health records or data in sectors such as energy, transportation, and public administration. Given that your portal will likely contain sensitive company documents, it's prudent to ensure compliance with this regulation if applicable.\n\nWould you like me to connect you with our NIS 2 specialist for a more detailed discussion on how these aspects might impact your project? This would help ensure that the security and privacy of data stored in \"Documents Portal\" are thoroughly protected, aligning well with your business goals around controlled access, data encryption, audit trails, and regulatory compliance."
