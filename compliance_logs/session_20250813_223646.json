To help me narrow down the best fit, could you tell me a little bit about the *type* of documents this project will be storing and how it will be used?  Specifically, are these documents:\n\n*   **Sensitive?** (e.g., financial data, employee records, trade secrets?)\n*   **Contractual?** (Do they relate to agreements with clients or partners?)\n*   **Legal?** (Are there specific legal requirements for the documents?)\n*   **Do you have a particular industry you\u2019re working in?** (e.g., healthcare, finance, legal?)\n\nKnowing a bit more about the document content and its purpose will help me determine which regulations are most applicable."
