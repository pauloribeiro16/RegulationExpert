It absolutely *does* fall under the scope of this project.\n\nNIS 2 (Network and Information Security Capability) is a European Union regulation focused on enhancing cybersecurity resilience to protect critical infrastructure. Your program needs to demonstrate that it\u2019s adequately protecting sensitive data, particularly if it\u2019s related to critical infrastructure.\n\nTo help me understand how best to guide you, could you tell me a bit more about *how* this project will be handling sensitive documents and the data involved?  For example, are you dealing with:\n\n*   **Specific critical infrastructure sectors?** (e.g., energy, transportation, finance)?\n*   **What types of documents are involved?** (e.g., contract terms, security protocols, employee records)?\n*   **What level of data encryption do you plan to use?**"
